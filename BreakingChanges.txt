change - IProxyGenerationHook.NonVirtualMemberNotification method was renamed

impact - high
fixability - easy
revision - 

description - to accommodate class proxies with target method NonVirtualMemberNotification on
	IProxyGenerationHook type was renamed to more accurate NonProxyableMemberNotification
	since for class proxies with target not just methods but also fields and other member that
	break the abstraction will be passed to this method.

fix - whenever NonVirtualMemberNotification is used/implemented change the method name to
	NonProxyableMemberNotification. Implementors should also accommodate possibility that not
	only MethodInfos will be passed as method's second parameter.

change - DynamicProxy will now allow to intercept members of System.Object

impact - very low
fixability - easy
revision - 

description - to allow scenarios like mocking of System.Object members, DynamicProxy will not
	disallow proxying of these methods anymore. AllMethodsHook (default IProxyGenerationHook)
	will still filter them out though.

fix - whenever custom IProxyGenerationHook is used, user should account for System.Object's
	members being now passed to ShouldInterceptMethod and NonVirtualMemberNotification methods
	and if neccessary update the code to handle them appropriately.
