change - DynamicProxy will now allow to intercept members of System.Object

impact - very low
fixability - easy
revision - 

description - to allow scenarios like mocking of System.Object members, DynamicProxy will not
	disallow proxying of these methods anymore. AllMethodsHook (default IProxyGenerationHook)
	will still filter them out though.

fix - whenever custom IProxyGenerationHook is used, user should account for System.Object's
	members being now passed to ShouldInterceptMethod and NonVirtualMemberNotification methods
	and if neccessary update the code to handle them appropriately.
